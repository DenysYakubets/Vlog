# Vlog: visual logging library for mobile
 
We created a very simple demo of the project (PFA video). In the demo,

The chat bubble is introduced to display logs in a non-intrusive manner.
The bubble would also show the count badge to indicate the presence of logs.
Filter capability is added since there can be too many logs (will be made richer)

This can be useful in many scenarios :

    - Quickly identify the cause of the issue (for Developers, Managers, DRIs)
    - Validate telemetry events are correctly fired on any user action (for PMs)
    - Delegate the issue to the right team (for Support Eng.)
    - Exposing selected logs, it can also be useful for 3p app developers to debug.
